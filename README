Foundations of Geometric Methods in Data Analysis Search algorithms in metric trees

Here are the different files you can find in this repository:

ALL OUR RESULTS ARE SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TWO NOTEBOOKS

NOTEBOOKS:
- Project.ipynb: contains our results for questions: 1, 2, 3, and 5
- 4. Image retrieval.ipynb: contains our results for question 4

PYTHON FILES

- metric_tree.py: implementation of the metric tree class with random choice of the pivot (Question 1)
- search_alg_visited_nodes.py: implementation of the exact pruning and defeatist search with visited number
of nodes (Question 1) 
- metric_forest.py: implementation of the metric forest class (Question 2)
- experiments.py: all the functions needed to perform the experiments described in Question 3: comparison
of the average number of visited nodes (Question 3)
- metric_tree_pivot.py: implementation of the metric tree class with an optimized choice for the pivot (Question 5)
- comparing_visited_nodes.py: contains all functions needed to compare both pivot choice methods
